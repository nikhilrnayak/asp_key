to change the way the CAP SLOCK led is turned on. Normally, the CAPSLOCK led is on when that key is pressed the first time and 
is turned off when it pressed again, and is on again when it is pressed the next time, and so on. Youâ€™ll change the code such 
that when the driver is in MODE1, CAPSLOCK will be handled as usual. However, when in MODE2, CAPSLOCK led will be off when 
CAPSLOCK is pressed the first time after transitioning to MODE2 and will be on when it is pressed the next time, and so on. 
MODE2 will be activated when NUMLOCK is pressed, CAPSLOCK is not pressed, and CAPSLOCK is not on at the moment. When 
transitioning to MODE2, the CAPSLOCK led will be turned on automatically. MODE2 will be active until NUMLOCK is pressed again. 
At this point your driver should leave the CAPSLOCK led status in a way that will be compatible with MODE1, e.g, whether the 
input layer thinks the CAPSLOCK is on or not.
